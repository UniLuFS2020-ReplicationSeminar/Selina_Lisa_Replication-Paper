# The ideological nationalization of partisan subconstituencies in the American States (2018)

## Introduction 
The paper "The ideological nationalization of partisan subconstituencies in the American States" (2018) by Caughey et al. enables to question and to re-consider previous knwoledge about the ideological polarization among the Congress members and the among the population. Before, there was a consensus that the accelarating and increasing polarization between Democrats and Republicans prevails among Congress members. Mass polarization among citizens were not measureable and therefore considered to be low and rather stable. Caughey et al. made a great contribution by showing that polarization among citizens existists and is increasing too. This was possible by using estimated scores about the ideological position of the average Democrats and Republicans using survey-data that covers attitudes about economic, racial, and social policy aggregated for each state.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
